# Crystals Collector
### A selection game that dynamically updates HTML pages with the jQuery library

#### 05/011/18 - Scott Johnson

## Project Goal
The Crystals Collector game demonstrates the use of the jQuery library to dynamically update HTML pages.  Events are included for capturing the user's image clicks and then executes through a sequence of logic steps to determine if the users score has exceeded the score to guess until which time the user either wins (guesses the score exactly) or overruns the score.

## Project Usefulness
This project incorporates jQuery learnings on how to correctly select and manipulate HTML elements within the DOM.
